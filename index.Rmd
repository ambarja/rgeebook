# Welcome {-}

This is the official website for the book [Earth Engine with R](). The book is 
intended for R users who wish to learn how to use R and [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/) together. There is a full overview of 
the GEE API functionality, multiple real-world applications, and a detailed description 
of all [rgee](https://github.com/r-spatial/rgee) and [rgeeExtra](https://github.com/r-earthengine/rgeeExtra/) features. The majority
of the examples are directly adapted from the original  [Earth Engine documentation](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides) and rebuilt in R.
